This repository includes several **real-world datasets** (see `dataset/` folder) for quick experimentation and demonstration:

dataset/
├── classification/
│     ├── faults.csv
│     └── Titanic-Dataset.csv
├── regression/

│     └── bodyfat_missing.csv
└── timeseries/
├── 1_Daily_minimum_temperatures.csv
├── COMED_hourly.csv
└── monthly_champagne_sales.csv

- **Classification:** Use `faults.csv` or `Titanic-Dataset.csv` for binary/multiclass classification examples.
- **Regression:** Try `AmesHousing.csv` (house price prediction) or `bodyfat_missing.csv` for regression tasks.
- **Time Series:** Use `1_Daily_minimum_temperatures.csv`, `COMED_hourly.csv`, or `monthly_champagne_sales.csv` for time series forecasting.

You can directly upload these datasets through the web UI to explore the automated pipeline and see how the platform works on different problem types.

## 7. 🔄 Automation Pipeline Details

This project fully automates every essential step of the data science pipeline. Once a user uploads their data, the following processes run automatically:

### • Automated EDA

- Automatically visualizes and reports key statistics, including data distribution, missing values, outliers, and feature summaries.
- Provides customized diagnostics for classification, regression, and time series tasks.

### • Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Handles missing values, detects and processes outliers, applies scaling and encoding—all with no manual intervention.
- For time series data, automatically creates time-based features (lag, rolling mean, etc.).
- Performs tailored feature engineering for categorical, numerical, and time series data types.

### • Model Search & Leaderboard

- Conducts automated hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation across multiple algorithms (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost, Ridge, Logistic Regression, etc.).
- Provides a leaderboard with the best-performing models and key candidate models for transparent comparison.

### • XAI & Reporting

- Applies Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP and Permutation Importance to visualize prediction results and feature influences.
- Automatically generates a comprehensive HTML report, summarizing the full process, evaluation metrics, and key insights.

## 9. Highlights

- **End-to-end AutoML pipeline.** From data upload through EDA, preprocessing, feature engineering, model search/tuning, evaluation, and an explainability (SHAP) report — driven from a single Streamlit UI with no coding required.
- **Multi-task.** Automatically detects and handles classification, regression, and time-series forecasting.
- **Robust data handling.** Missing values, outliers, categorical/numerical features, and time formats are processed automatically, with sampling fallbacks for large files.
- **Built-in explainability.** SHAP and permutation importance are generated automatically and bundled into a downloadable HTML report.
- **Modular codebase.** The `automl/` package is split by task type (`classification/`, `regression/`, `timeseries/`) with separate `eda`, `preprocessing`, `model_search`, `evaluation`, and `report` modules.
